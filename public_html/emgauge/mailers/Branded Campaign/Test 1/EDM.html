      <br />
      At CRY America, ours is a vision of creating a ‘just' society where every child has his/her right to live, thrive, learn and grow and achieve their full potential. <br />
      <br />
      We do not believe in charity. We don’t build schools or run orphanages. Instead, we partner NGOs working with children, their parents, and communities.  We believe that the ‘Rights Approach’ is the most effective way to ensure sustainable change.  We mobilize communities and civil society to address and tackle the root causes of illiteracy, poverty, discrimination and exploitation that lead to the violation of child rights.<br />
      <br />
      As adults enjoying our human rights, we have a responsibility- that all children have their human rights ensured too. Your belief, your support, your money has so far ensured rights of 156, 503 children to survive, protect, develop and participate in just 5 years - -making it lasting and impactful. <br />
      <br />
      In order to ensure your contributions are invested in our common vision in which all children have rights, CRY America and CRY in India (CRY America’s partner) have stringent processes.  <br />
      <br />
